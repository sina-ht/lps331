*** How to use

First, find where your device is attached.  i.e. I2C bus and slave address.
Adjust LPS331_I2C_BUS and LPS331_SLAVE_ADDR in lps331-get.c and lps331.c.
Your device's slave address would be 0x5c or 0x5d, depending on how the
device is wired.  i2cdetect might help you.

Just type 'make' to compile on your target board.
To cross-compile, adjust CC variable in Makefile. (Not tested)

Run './lps331-get' to check if the device is connected and works.

lps331 is the daemon to collect the pressure data every five minutes
and put into rrd database.
rrd database create script is also provided as pressure-create-rrd.sh.
Use RRDtool's rrdcgi to view the pressure graph via your browser.
Below is the snippet of my sensors.cgi.
See http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/ about RRDtool.
